# hello-world-1
Hi there! This is a website test I decided to make a month ago. I've now started using Visual Studio Code, so expect my projects to be a bit better. Im coding this in HTML currently, because I don't know CSS or JavaScript yet. Anyways, thanks for checking this out. If you want to help, add an issue or make a pull request with your commit. Thanks :)
